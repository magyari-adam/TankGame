A multiplayer tactical tank shooter game.

This game operates on the 10273 port, so be sure to forward it if you wanna play with your buddies over the internet.

Currently only supports 2 players.
(And might have a slight issue with starting new matches.
Just restart the game if you want to start a new game.)

The host starts on the left, and the client starts on the right.
The controls are simple:
- left and right arrow keys to move your tank left or right
- up and down arrow keys to tilt the turret up or down
- space to lock in your position and shot
